Thank you for installing WSO2 Identity Server.

Please follow these steps to access the Management Console.

1. Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

  kubectl get ing -n <Namespace>

    NAME                                 HOSTS                  ADDRESS        PORTS     AGE
    wso2is-pattern-2-dashboard-ingress   <DASHBOARD_HOST_NAME>   <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   3m
    wso2is-pattern-2-is-ingress          <IS_HOST_NAME>          <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   3m

2. Add the above host as an entry in /etc/hosts file as follows:

    <EXTERNAL-IP>   <DASHBOARD_HOST_NAME>
    <EXTERNAL-IP>   <IS_HOST_NAME> 

3. Navigate to https://<IS_HOST_NAME>/carbon and https://<DASHBOARD_HOST_NAME>/portal in your browser of choice.
